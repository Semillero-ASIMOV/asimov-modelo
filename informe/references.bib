A well-designed simulator makes it possible to rapidly test algorithms, design robots, perform regression testing, and train AI system using realistic scenarios. Gazebo offers the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. At your fingertips is a robust physics engine, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic and graphical interfaces. Best of all, Gazebo is free with a vibrant community.},

	abstract = {Omnidirectional mobile robots with Mecanum wheels have been increased their use in the industry in the last few years. In this work, a new kinematic modeling is presented, which describes its operation and allows to control its movements. For testing the kinematic modeling of the robot it was programmed, on a functional model, a series of physical tests using a software of simulation, the software ReacTIVision and artificial potential field approach. The results show that the kinematics developed in this paper is correct for the "AB" wheel configuration and also, that the mobile robot is omnidirectional.},
